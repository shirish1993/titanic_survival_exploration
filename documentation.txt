Three most important features are:
1. Sex
2. Age
3. Pclass

since most of the male less than 10 years of age survived, so no point optimising this part.
Lets look at the else part [sex is male and age > 10]
	we will notice that just putting another condition of class == 1 reduce the probability to 75.42%
	we again notice that class = 1 and age < 40 has more chance of survival, we put age filter as well, this time the accuracy rose to 79.12%
lets now focus toward female sex
	we notice that the female in class 3 has lesser chance of surviva, we put in extra condition of class inside female file, which did not affect the accuracy
	we can also see that the female has lesser chance of probabilty whose age is between 40 & 60, this just increased the accuracy to 80.02%
